Description: This package is for single-cell sequencing analysis that split cells to small 
    groups of equal size, and create 'meta-cell' by averaging their expression. The splitting 
    is based on nearest neighbors to retain heterogeneity to some level.
    This package can be seen as a Seurat wrapper that takes a Seurat object as input and output.
